Usage: `weather.py [options] location_code`

    $ weather.py --help
for options and their descriptions.

Weather data can be printed to an output file with the `--output` option.

    $ weather.py 24060 --output='weather.txt'

If a weather report cannot be generated, the specified output file is not
altered. This is useful when attempting to cache weather output while, for
instance, on a flaky network connection. To attempt to update the weather file
and output its contents, one could use the following command. If the weather
could not be loaded, the previous contents of the file are shown.

    $ weather.py 24060 --output='weather.txt' && cat weather.txt
